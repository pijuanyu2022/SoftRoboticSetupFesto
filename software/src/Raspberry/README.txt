Usage:
python3 runrobot_Festo.py -i <[I2C channels]> -p <Port>

Example:
python3 runrobot_Festo.py -i 1,3 -p 12345

I2C channels indicate the channels to which the VEAB boards are connected. The order of the channels determines the numbering of sensors&actuators.
Sensors and actuators come in pairs (VEAB), and they are counted sequentially:
Channel1VEAB1->Channel1VEAB2->Channel2VEAB1->Channel2VEAB2->....

The Port is the port that TCP/IP uses (must be the same here and MATLAB/Simulink)

The "datasize" variable must be 2*(No. of VEAB boards)



The workflow is as following:

To performm an experiment:
0. Plug in the Pi and the power supply
1. Connect to the pi: In cmd, type ssh pi@IPaddress, enter password
2. Enter the directory where the code is located, for example: cd SoRo
3. Run the python file using the command above
4. Run the Simulink/Matlab file

After experiments:
1. Turn off the Pi: sudo poweroff
2. Unplug all the power supplies
